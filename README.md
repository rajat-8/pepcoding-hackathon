# pepcoding-hackathon
The goal of the project is to automate a task only using tech stack of HTML, CSS, JS

# Automated-Dictionary
## Introduction
In this project, I have automated the website and workings of [dictionary.com](https://www.dictionary.com/) <br>

## Keywords 
- 'wotd' -> displays 'word of the day'
- 'trending' -> displays all the 'trending' words available on the home page

## Running the file
- The first way is to use "node script.js 'word/ keyword'"
- The second way is to use "findx 'word/keyword'"

## Working
The project automates the following commands
1. 'findx wotd' -> this displays the word of the day along with its phonetic sounds and meaning
2. 'findx trending' -> this displays and saves all the trending words available on the homepage of the website. The words are then stored in a separate file in JSON format.
3.  "findx 'word' -> there are 2 possibilities for this case
>  - If the word is available in the dictionary, it will print the word along with phonetic sounds and meaning
>  - if the word is not available meaning the word is gibberish then it will print that and will print the word of the day instead.
